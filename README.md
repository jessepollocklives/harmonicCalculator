This was a project for my programming fundamentals class

It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

JS concepts demostrated include the following:
* functions
* if/else statements
* for loops
* while loops
* nested logic
* separating input, processing, and output

Fun Fact: this was also my first readme written with Markdown syntax
